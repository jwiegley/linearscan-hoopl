description:
  This module provides two convenience features for Hoopl users that wish to
  use @linearscan@ for register allocation in their compilers.
  .
  First, it defines a type class called 'NodeAlloc'. After defining an
  instance of this class for your particular graph node type, simply call
  'LinearScan.Hoopl.allocateHoopl'. This is a simpler interface than using
  @linearscan@ directly, which requires two records of functions that are more
  general in nature than the methods of 'NodeAlloc'.
  .
  Second, it provides a DSL for constructing assembly language DSLs that
  compile into Hoople program graphs. See the tests for a concrete example.
  This is mainly useful for constructing tests of intermediate representations.
  .
  Please see the tests for an example of the simple assembly language that is
  used to test the @linearscan@ allocator.
